# Form-a-Story
Form a Story from Codecademy: HTML forms
For this project, iâ€™ll use my knowledge of the HTML <form> and grab user input to put a spin on a classic story!

The logic for parsing and inserting of user inputs is already taken care of in main.js using JavaScript .I have also added some styling to the page in style.css.
